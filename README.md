# Movie Success Analysis and Prediction

This project utilizes data science techniques and visualization to analyze and predict the success of movies. By leveraging various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and scikit-learn, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing the success of movies and build predictive models.

## Introduction

Understanding what makes a movie successful is crucial in the film industry. This project delves into the analysis of various factors affecting a movie's success, including budget, genre, cast, and release timing. Additionally, predictive models are developed to forecast the success of future movies based on historical data.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sujana0510/Movie-success-and-prediction_DATA-ANALYSIS.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter notebook `movie_success_analysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis and prediction process.

```
cd Movie-success-and-prediction_DATA-ANALYSIS
jupyter notebook Movie-success-and-prediction_DATA-ANALYSIS.ipylb
```

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from [IMDB-Movie-Data.csv](https://github.com/sujana0510/Movie-success-and-prediction_DATA-ANALYSIS/files/15064400/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv)
 . It consists of various attributes of movies such as budget, genre, cast, release date, and box office performance.

## Analysis

The analysis phase involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different variables and the success metrics of movies. Visualizations are used to depict trends and patterns in the data, helping to identify factors influencing movie success.

## Prediction

Predictive models are built using machine learning algorithms to forecast the success of movies. Features such as budget, genre, and cast are used to train regression models, which are then evaluated based on performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
